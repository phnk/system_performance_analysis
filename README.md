# Computer performance analysis
This repo contains my notes, seminar notes and project results from the third cycle studies course "Computer systems performance analysis" at LTU.
The main goal of this course is to understand how the performance of computer systems can be evaulated and what type of methodologies exist to do so.

The literature used within this course is ISBN: 0471503363.
The course is based on material from the course [CSE567M](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse567-17/index.html) at wustl.

The course is divided into three different phases. Firstly, watch pre-recorded lectures. Secondly, a demonstration of selected performance analysis tool and/or proof on concept. This perferebly related to ones research. Lastly, a review and presentation of a selected research paper on the topic of performance analysis.

The repo is structured as the following:  
`/notes` contains notes for each pre-recorder lecture.  
`/seminar_notes` contains notes for the given seminars within the course.  
`/project` contains all files for the project in the course.
