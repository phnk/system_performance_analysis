# [Operational Laws](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse567-17/k_33ol.htm)
* What are operation laws? 
	- Relationship that do not require any assumptions about the distribution of service times or inter-arrival times.
	- Operational -> Directly measured
	- Operationally testable assumptions -> Assumptions that can be verified by measurements.
* Operational quantities
	- Quantities that can be directly measured during a finite observation period.
	- For example: arrival rate, throughput, utilization
* Operational laws are similar to elementary law of motion
* Operational assumptions: flow balance.
* Some operational laws 
	- Utilization Law: Relates utilization to throughput and service time
	- Forced Flow Law: Relates the system throughput to individual device throughputs
	- Bottleneck device: The device with the highest total service demand has the highest utilization and is the bottleneck device
* Example 33.2 See book
* Transition probabilities
	- Probability of a job moving from one queue to another after completion in one of the queues.
	- Visit ration equations
	- From visit ratio you can calculate the transition probabilities and vica versa
* Little's law
	- Mean number in the device = Arrival rate * mean time in the device
	- For any network
* General response time law
* Interactive response time law
* Bottleneck analysis
	- Bottleneck device: the device that has the highest utilization
	- The bottleneck device is the key limiting factor in achieving higher throughput.
* Asymptotic bounds
* Optimal operating point
	- Control policy: derivative is positive, continue. otherwise go backwards. (find the knee in the curve)
