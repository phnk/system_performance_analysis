[Introduction to Experimental Designs](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse567-17/k_16ied.htm)
* What is experimental design / How to do the experiments?
	- Design a proper set of experiments for measurement or simulation
	- Devlop a model that describes the data obtained
	- Estimate the contribution of each alternative
	- Isolate the measurement errors
	- Estimate confidence intervals for model parameters
	- Check if the alternatives are significally different
	- Check if the model is adequate
* Terminology
	- Response variable: outcome
	- Factor: Variables that affect the response variable
	- Levels: The values that a factor can assume
	- Primarmy factor: The factors that need to be quantified
	- Secondary Factors: Factors that do not need to be quantified
	- Replication: Repetion of all or some experiments
	- Design: Some type of design, together with number of experiments, factor levels and number of replications
	- Experimental unit: The entity used for the experiments
	- Interaction: The effect on one of the factors upon the level of another factor
* Common mistakes in experimentation
	- The variation due to experimental error is ignored
	- Important paramters are not controlled
	- Effects of different factors are not isolated
	- Simple one-factor-at-a-time design are used
	- Interactions are ignored
	- Too many experiments are conducted
* Types of experimental designs
	- Simple designs: Vary one factor at a time.
		1. Not statistically efficient
		2. Wrong conclusions if factors have some type of interaction
		3. Not recommended
	- Full Factorial Design: All combinations.
		1. Can find the effect of all factors
		2. Too much time and money
		3. May try 2^k design first
* Summary
	- Goal of a proper experimental design is to get the maximum information using minimum amount of experiments
	- The things we consider when designing experiments: Factors, levels and full-factorial designs
