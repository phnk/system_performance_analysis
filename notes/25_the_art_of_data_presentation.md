# [The Art of Data Presentation](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse567-17/k_10adp.htm)

* Types of variables
	- Qualitative
		1. Ordered
		2. Unordered
	- Quantiative
		1. Discrete
		2. Contiuous
* Type of computer
* Type of workload
* Number of processors
* Response time of the system
* Guidelines for preparing good charts
	- Require minimum effort from the reader
	- Maximize information
	- Minimize the ink
	- Use commonly accepted practices
	- Avoid abmiguity
	- For more: see checklist in Box 10.1
	- Presenting too many alternatives in a single chart
	- Presenting many y variables in a single chart
	- Using symolbs in place of text
	- Placing extraneous information on the chart
	- Selecting scale ranges improperly
	- Using a line chart in place of a column chart
* Pictorial games
	- Using non-zero origins to emphasize the difference
	- Using double-whammy graph for dramatization
	- Plotting random quantities without showing confidence intervals
	- Pictograms scaled by height rather than width.
	- Using inappropriate cell size in histograms
	- Using broken scales in column charts
* Performance analysis rat holes
	- Workload
	- Metrics
	- Configuration
	- Details
* Reasons for not accepting an analysis
	- This needs more analysis.
	- You need a better understanding of the workload.
	- It improves performance only for long IOs/packets and most are short.
	- It improves performance only for shrot IOs/packets and who cares when long are the ones that impact the system.
	- Needs too much memory/CPU/bandwidth and thats expensive.
	- It only saves us memory/CPU/bandwith and thats cheap.
	- For more see box 10.2 for a complete list.
